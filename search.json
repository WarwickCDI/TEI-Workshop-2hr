Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see price list).\nVisual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can download VSCode for free and, after installation, install the tei-publisher-vscode and Red Hat XML extension. The interface is a bit more intimidating and some more advanced TEI features may not be supported. It should be find for the introductory content in this workshop.\nüìÖ TBC\n‚è∞TBC\nüè†Location"

    "text": "Overview\nHow do you encode a text in digital form? Historical texts are rich with information. Simple text is not enough. Some text may be highlighted or crossed out. There may be locations or people referred to. Indeed, the encoder may choose to add annotations or other interpretive elements. The Text Encoding Initiative guidelines suggest how we can encode that data in an XML format. Using XML produces rich digital formats which can turned into digital editions and be explored using program languages such as R and Python.\nIn this workshop you will:\n\nGet hands on experience using the Oxygen XML editor to encode a TEI document\nExplore the different encoding options available\nConsider the impact of the guidelines on text encoding and your own decisions on what to encode\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nTime (mins)\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n10\n\n\nCreating TEI Files\n30\n\n\nActivity 2\n15\n\n\nRoundup and session close\n5"

This line is needed but it beyond the scope of our session to delve into all the details.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\nNext we specify the rules we want to follow.\n<?xml-model href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng\" type=\"application/xml\" schematypens=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\"?>\n<?xml-model href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng\" type=\"application/xml\" schematypens=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"?>\nWe are specifying the particular xml models we want to use. An XML model has a tree structure - that is, a particular <node> may by within other specific <nodes>.\nWait, what? That may sound confusing but let us look at the teiHeader section of our file.\n<teiHeader>\n    <fileDesc>\n       <titleStmt>\n          <title>Title</title>\n       </titleStmt>\n       <publicationStmt>\n          <p>Publication Information</p>\n       </publicationStmt>\n       <sourceDesc>\n          <p>Information about the source</p>\n       </sourceDesc>\n    </fileDesc>\n</teiHeader>\nAs a tree, this section look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the XML model, a teiHeader can contain several other nodes including fileDesc. In fileDesc, the titleStml, publicationStmt and sourceDesc are allowed. These links will take you to the TEI documentation which is available online. The remainder of the file contains the text node, within which is the body and in that is a paragraph.\nThe ruleset (guidelines) may seem restrictive, but it provides a standardised way to encode our text. We can also use the guidelines as prompts to consider what we might want to encode."

The model tab shows the rules for the selected node. If we select the fileDesc node then we see a description of the node from the TEI guidelines, the possible child nodes (titleStmt, publicationStmt) and the possible attributes. An attribute is information attached to the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attributes tab allows you to easily change an attribute of a node. More on that in the second activity.\nIn the Text tab (where the file text is shown) you can create a new node by opening a < bracket. Oxygen XML will then show you a list of the available nodes (keeping within the TEI rules). For instance, you can create a location node as a child node of p (paragraph)."

To help you, let us consider the page for the pb element. There is a description of the element an a link to a grouping of similar elements (here the grouping of Milestone Elements is relevant).\n\nThe pb element is part of the ‚Äòcore elements‚Äô. James Cummings has an excellent set of slides about core components here."
