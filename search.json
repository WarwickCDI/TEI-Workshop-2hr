Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see price list).\nVisual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can download VSCode for free and, after installation, install the tei-publisher-vscode and Red Hat XML extension. The interface is a bit more intimidating and some more advanced TEI features may not be supported. It should be find for the introductory content in this workshop.\nüìÖ TBC\n‚è∞TBC\nüè†Location"
