Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see price list).\nVisual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can download VSCode for free and, after installation, install the tei-publisher-vscode and Red Hat XML extension.

The remainder of the file contains the text node, within which is the body and in that is a paragraph.\nThe ruleset (guidelines) may seem restrictive, but it provides a standardised way to encode our text.

These guidelines cover a lot of different use cases designed to help academics capture lots of different parts of a source.\nWhen you first look at the documentation it can be tricky to understand. To help you, let us consider the page for the pb element. There is a description of the element an a link to a grouping of similar elements (here the grouping of Milestone Elements is relevant).\n\nThe pb element is part of the ‚Äòcore elements‚Äô. Dr James Cummings has an excellent set of slides about core components. You can see the slides by going here or viewing them below.\n\n\n\nElements can have attributes. For example, <pb n=‚Äú55‚Äù/> is a the pb element with the attribute n which has a value of 55. That indicates the start of page number 55. The is indicated by the @n in attributes.\n\nElements are contained within other elements. The pb element can be contained within the body element (as it is in the Orwell diary document) as well as any other element listed in the ‚ÄòContained by‚Äô section.\n\nAnother helpful section are the examples. These examples may not include your use case, but are reasonable guides. For instance, if you wanted to include the images of diary page then you would use the face attribute of the pb element."

Be sure to provide a place for the addition and how it should be rendered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe have a few new elements to look at.\nDates are marked up using the date element. The element has a when attribute to record the actual date. This make sense if we want to accurately record dates even when some has written ‚Äòmidweek‚Äô or ‚Äòterm 2 - week 9‚Äô. For our purposes, we can record a date as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEI documentation: <date>\nPlace names indicates, to no surprise, the name of a place. The name of the place should be within the PlaceName element. You can add an attribute to indicate how certain you are that this is a placename.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also want to add the spatial co-ordinates of a place. The geo element, which can be placed in the location element within placeName, lets you specify the geolocation of the place. For instance, this would look like the below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, you may want to indicate the project of the co-ordinates (discussion of this goes beyond this page). We need not worry in our case because our co-ordinate projection is WGS84 and co-ordinates within geo are assumed to follow WGS84, see the documentation on the varieties of location.\nTEI documentation: <placeName>\nUse the name element with the attribute type to indicate a newspaper. In Orwell‚Äôs diary this may look something like.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEI documentation: <name>\nYou can encode deleted text via the del element. The rend attribute indicates how the deletion should be displayed when the document is rendered into PDF or HTML. For our purposes, we will treat deletions as an overstrike.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEI documentation: \nText which has been added to the document is represented using the add element. We would usually indicate the position of the addition using the place attribute and render it as an insertion in outputs. For example, adding the word four by writing it above would be.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEI documentation: <add>\nNote the place indication of ‚Äòsupralinear‚Äô. I have also indicated that this is the second in a series of actions using the seq attribute. In my document, I assume the number 4 is removed and then the word four is added above.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can show text is highlighted (hi) by underline like so.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEI documentation: <hi>"
