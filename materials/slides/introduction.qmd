# Why

## Text Encoding

* What is text encoding?

. . .

* [William Godwins Diary](http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/index2.html)

. . .

* [Jane Austen's Fictional Manuscripts](https://janeausten.ac.uk/about/overview.html)

. . .

* [Another example]() 
  
And far more.
  
## But, why?

Academic resources are often encoded into a digital text form.

For example,

* Historical literature
* Speeches
* Poetry

. . .

allowing easy searching, distribution, archiving, computational analysis and
the inclusion of additional information.

## The challenge

* Finding a text format and rules
* Deciding what to include
* Using software to help you out

# Text Encoding Initiative

## Community help

* Our format is XML
* The TEI consortium provide rules (or, rather, [guidelines](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html))
* There is an active community (e.g., recent TEI 2022 conference, [@TEI2022](https://twitter.com/TEI2022))

  <l>I saw my soul at rest upon a <rhyme label="a" xml:id="A">day</rhyme></l>

  <l>Among soft leaves that give the starlight <rhyme label="a" xml:id="C">way</rhyme></l>
  <l>To touch its wings but not its eyes with <rhyme label="b" xml:id="D">light</rhyme>;</l>
  <l>So that it knew as one in visions <rhyme label="a" xml:id="E">may</rhyme>,</l>
  <l>And knew not as men waking, of <rhyme label="b" xml:id="F">delight</rhyme>.</l>
