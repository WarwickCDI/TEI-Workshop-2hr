## Why?

> "Scholarly digital editions (or SDEs) offer the opportunity to overcome the limitations of print technology. The new possibilities have a fundamental impact on the theory and methodology of critical editing in general. The large corpus of research literature on digital scholarly editing is full of discussion about new features, functions, properties and characteristics of this kind of scholarly endeavour and how this changes our practices, our theoretical grounds and our goals."

## What?

-   **Digitise and archive the document.** Create a representation of a physical document (e.g., letter from Van Gogh) in a digital plain text file.

-   **Enrich the text and encode additional features.** Structure such as paragraphs, strikethrough, editorial comments, uncertainty.

-   **Machine readable.** Can be turned into rich websites such as Godwin's diary and filtered for computational analysis.
