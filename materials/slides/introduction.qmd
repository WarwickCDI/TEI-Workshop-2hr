# Plan

* Why?
* TEI
* Editors

# Why

## Digital Editions

* What are Digital Editions?

. . .

* [William Godwins Diary](http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/index2.html)

. . .

* [Jane Austen's Fictional Manuscripts](https://janeausten.ac.uk/about/overview.html)

. . .

* [Another example]() 
  
And far more.
  
## But, why?

There are times when academic resources are encoded in a digital textual 
form. For instance,

* Historical literature
* Speeches
* Poetry

. . .

What does this offer?

* searchable
* long term archiving
* computational analysis
* including additional information

## The challenge

* finding a text format and rules
* deciding what to include
* using helpful software

# Text Encoding Initiative

## Community

* The TEI consortium provide rules (or, rather, [guidelines](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html))
* There is an active community (e.g., recent TEI 2022 conference, [@TEI2022](https://twitter.com/TEI2022))
* Uses a plain text XML file

## What?
