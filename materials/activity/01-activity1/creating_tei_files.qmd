# Oxygen XML

The instructions below are for opening and creating a TEI document using Oxygen XML.

1.  Open the Oxygen XML program. If you are in room R0.39 then open the start menu type in oxygen. You should see the application.

2.  Once open, select New Document. When you are faced with the document type select TEI P5 All and then click create.

Oxygen will load in a template document ready for you to use the TEI guidelines.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>
<TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  <teiHeader>
      <fileDesc>
         <titleStmt>
            <title>Title</title>
         </titleStmt>
         <publicationStmt>
            <p>Publication Information</p>
         </publicationStmt>
         <sourceDesc>
            <p>Information about the source</p>
         </sourceDesc>
      </fileDesc>
  </teiHeader>
  <text>
      <body>
         <p>Some text here.</p>
      </body>
  </text>
</TEI>
```

## XML and TEI

The XML files is a series of tags such as \<text\>.

This line tells us we are using XML version 1 and the file encoding. This line is needed but it beyond the scope of our session to delve into all the details.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

Next we specify the rules we want to follow.

``` xml
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>
```

We are specifying the particular xml models we want to use. An XML model has a tree structure - that is, a particular \<node\> may by within other specific \<nodes\>.

Wait, what? That may sound confusing but let us look at the teiHeader section of our file.

``` xml
<teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>
       <titleStmt>
          <title>Title</title>
       </titleStmt>
       <publicationStmt>
          <p>Publication Information</p>
       </publicationStmt>
       <sourceDesc>
          <p>Information about the source</p>
       </sourceDesc>
    </fileDesc>
</teiHeader>
```

As a tree, this section look like this.

![](/materials/images/tei_header.png){fig-alt="Tree representation of node stucture" fig-align="center"}

Within the XML model, a [teiHeader](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD11) can contain several other nodes including fileDesc. In [fileDesc](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-fileDesc.html), the [titleStml](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-titleStmt.html), [publicationStmt](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-publicationStmt.html) and [sourceDesc](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-sourceDesc.html) are allowed. These links will take you to the TEI documentation which is available online. The remainder of the file contains the [text](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-text.html) node, within which is the [body](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-body.html) and in that is a [paragraph](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-p.html).

The ruleset may seem restrictive, but it provides a standardised way to encode our text. We can also use the guidelines as prompts to consider what we might want to encode.

# Encoding

We are going to work on encoding a page from [George Orwell's political diary 1940-41](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/orwells-political-diary-1940-41). Several photographs of the diary are available to view on the British Library website. Note the usage terms from the website. We will stick strictly to these terms and only use the image for educational purposes.

    George Orwell: © With kind permission of the estate of the late Sonia Brownell Orwell. You may not use the material for commercial purposes. Please credit the copyright holder when reusing this work.

    UCL: © Orwell Archive, UCL Library Special Collections.

Our goal at the end of this first activity is to have a TEI document with the file description and the basic formatting of the page.
