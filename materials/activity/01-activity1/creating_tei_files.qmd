# Oxygen XML

The instructions below are for opening and creating a TEI document using Oxygen XML.

1.  Open the Oxygen XML program. If you are in room R0.39 then open the start menu type in oxygen. You should see the application.

2.  Once open, select New Document. When you are faced with the document type select TEI P5 All and then click create.

Oxygen will load in a template document ready for you to use the TEI guidelines.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>
<TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  <teiHeader>
      <fileDesc>
         <titleStmt>
            <title>Title</title>
         </titleStmt>
         <publicationStmt>
            <p>Publication Information</p>
         </publicationStmt>
         <sourceDesc>
            <p>Information about the source</p>
         </sourceDesc>
      </fileDesc>
  </teiHeader>
  <text>
      <body>
         <p>Some text here.</p>
      </body>
  </text>
</TEI>
```

## XML and TEI

The XML files is a series of tags such as \<text\>.

This line tells us we are using XML version 1 and the file encoding. This line is needed but it beyond the scope of our session to delve into all the details.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

Next we specify the rules we want to follow.

``` xml
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/relaxng/tei_all.rng" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>
```

We are specifying the particular xml models we want to use. An XML model has a tree structure - that is, a particular \<node\> may by within other specific \<nodes\>.

Wait, what? That may sound confusing but let us look at the teiHeader section of our file.

``` xml
<teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>
       <titleStmt>
          <title>Title</title>
       </titleStmt>
       <publicationStmt>
          <p>Publication Information</p>
       </publicationStmt>
       <sourceDesc>
          <p>Information about the source</p>
       </sourceDesc>
    </fileDesc>
</teiHeader>
```

As a tree, this section look like this.

![](/materials/images/tei_header.png){fig-alt="Tree representation of node stucture" fig-align="center"}

Within the XML model, a [teiHeader](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD11) can contain several other nodes including fileDesc. In [fileDesc](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-fileDesc.html), the [titleStml](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-titleStmt.html), [publicationStmt](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-publicationStmt.html) and [sourceDesc](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-sourceDesc.html) are allowed. These links will take you to the TEI documentation which is available online. The remainder of the file contains the [text](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-text.html) node, within which is the [body](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-body.html) and in that is a [paragraph](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-p.html).

The ruleset may seem restrictive, but it provides a standardised way to encode our text. We can also use the guidelines as prompts to consider what we might want to encode.

# Encoding

We are going to work on encoding a page from [George Orwell's political diary 1940-41](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/orwells-political-diary-1940-41). Several photographs of the diary are available to view on the British Library website. Note the usage terms from the website.

*George Orwell: © With kind permission of the estate of the late Sonia Brownell Orwell. You may not use the material for commercial purposes. Please credit the copyright holder when reusing this work.*

*UCL: © Orwell Archive, UCL Library Special Collections.*

We will stick strictly to these terms and only use the image for educational purposes.

## Document description

1.  [Open up Oxygen XML and start a new document using all the TEI P5 guidelines.]{.underline}
2.  [Fill out details about the document title, publication information and information about the source.]{.underline}

*Note*: How do you choose what information to include? What's important?

## Helpful Oxygen XML

The Oxygen XML interface is designed to help you.

-   In the bottom left is a tree, much like the screenshot above. If you click on the a node name, such as fileDesc, all of the child nodes are selected (see below image).

    ![](/materials/images/OxygenXMLEditor.png){fig-alt="Oxygen XML editor with the fileDesc node and child nodes highlighted" fig-align="center"}

-   In the top right are two tabs: attributes and model. The model tab shows the rules for the selected node. If we select the fileDesc node then we see a description of the node from the TEI guidelines, the possible child nodes (titleStmt, publicationStmt) and the possible attributes. An attribute is information attached to the node.

![](/materials/images/OxygenXMLModel.png){fig-alt="The model tab for the fileDesc node displayed in the Oxygen XML editor" fig-align="center"}

-   The attributes tab allows you to easily change an attribute of a node. More on that in the second activity.

-   In the Text tab (where the file text is shown) you can create a new node by opening a \< bracket. Oxygen XML will then show you a list of the available nodes (keeping within the TEI rules). For instance, you can create a location node as a child node of p (paragraph).

## Encoding text structure

1.  Write some or all of the text from a page of the Orwell diary.
2.  Add structural information. For instance, the <p> node to indicate a paragraph. If you include dates then use [\<date when=""\>text\</date\>](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-date.html)
3.  Click on the Author tab. What does it show you? Spend a few minutes looking at going through the interface and looking at the different options.
