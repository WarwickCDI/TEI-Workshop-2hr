## Pre Work

Our work will require an editor which can work with TEI XML documents.

**If you are in R0.39 on Warwick campus then Oxygen XML is already installed.**

Alternatively:

1.  Get access to the Oxygen XML editor in some other way. Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see [price list](https://www.oxygenxml.com/buy-academic.html)).
2.  Visual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can [download VSCode for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and, after installation, install the [tei-publisher-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=e-editiones.tei-publisher-vscode) and [Red Hat XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) extension. The interface is a bit more intimidating and some more advanced TEI features may not be supported. It should be find for the introductory content in this workshop.
