## Pre Work

Our work will require an editor which can work with TEI XML documents.

**If you are in R0.39 on Warwick campus then Oxygen XML is already installed.**

Alternatively:

1.  Get access to the Oxygen XML editor in some other way. Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see [price list](https://www.oxygenxml.com/buy-academic.html)).
2.  Visual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can [download VSCode for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and, after installation, install the [tei-publisher-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=e-editiones.tei-publisher-vscode) and [Red Hat XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) extension. The interface is a bit more intimidating and some more advanced TEI features may not be supported. It should be find for the introductory content in this workshop.

## Overview

How do you encode a text in digital form? Historical texts are rich with information. Simple text is not enough. Some text may be highlighted or crossed out. There may be locations or people referred to. Indeed, the encoder may choose to add annotations or other interpretive elements. The Text Encoding Initiative guidelines suggest how we can encode that data in an XML format. Using XML produces rich digital formats which can turned into digital editions and be explored using program languages such as R and Python.

In this workshop you will:

-   Get hands on experience using the Oxygen XML editor to encode a TEI document

-   Explore the different encoding options available

-   Consider the impact of the guidelines on text encoding and your own decisions on what to encode
