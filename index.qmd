## Pre Work

Our work will require an editor which can work with TEI XML documents.

**If you are in R0.39 on Warwick campus then Oxygen XML is already installed.**

Alternatively:

1.  Get access to the Oxygen XML editor in some other way. Some academic institutions have an institutional license. Alternatively, the editor can be purchased for a high price (see [price list](https://www.oxygenxml.com/buy-academic.html)).
2.  Visual Studio code (VSCode) is a technical text editor with TEI support. You can [download VSCode for free](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and, after installation, install the [tei-publisher-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=e-editiones.tei-publisher-vscode) and [Red Hat XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) extension. The interface is a bit more intimidating and some more advanced TEI features may not be supported. It should be find for the introductory content in this workshop.

## Overview

How do you encode a text in digital form?

Texts are often quite complicated and nuanced. Plain text is not good enough. For instance, how do we include:

* Locations or places
* Editorial decisions where text is removed or additions

and, as we encode the text, we may be uncertain about parts.

Files written in XML following the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines allow us to include much more than plain text.

In this workshop we create an encoding of pages from George Orwell's Political Diary using the TEI Guidelines.
